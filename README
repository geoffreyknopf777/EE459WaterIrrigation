Welcome to the Team 4 EE459 Water Irrigation Project!

We are students from the University of Southern California.

This code is designed for the ATmega328P chip using the avrdude programming tool.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
	The "src" directory contains all the source code for the project.
	The "bin" directory contains all the object files that are linked into the final executable program, "main.hex" 
		which is loaded into the EEPROM of the ATmega328P.
	
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:	
	To build the code, simply type "make" in this directory.
	To remove object files, type "make clean".
	To configure the chip for the first time, type "make fuse".
	To program the chip, type "make flash".
